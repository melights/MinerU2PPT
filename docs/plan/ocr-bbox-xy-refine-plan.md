# OCR BBox XY联合精修 Task Blueprint

## I100
- Subject: Implement XY bbox refine in OCR pipeline
- Description: PRD Section Refs: [PRD §2.1, PRD §3.1, PRD §4 FR-001, PRD §4 FR-002]. Runtime Task ActiveForm: Implementing XY bbox refine in OCR pipeline. Update `converter/ocr_merge.py` so the existing Y-direction refine flow also computes X-direction refinement (column flags + left/right trim and extend) in the same processing path for element and line bboxes; keep invalid-box fallback behavior; include unit-test intent by defining expected bbox sync outcomes for element/line/span after XY refine.
- Blocked By: None
- Acceptance: `refine_ocr_text_elements` applies XY refinement in one flow, element/line/span bbox updates are coordinated, and behavior falls back to original bbox when refined boxes are invalid.

## Q200
- Subject: Add unit coverage for X refinement and bbox sync
- Description: PRD Section Refs: [PRD §4 FR-002, PRD §4 FR-003, PRD §4 FR-004, PRD §5 AG-001, PRD §5 AG-002, PRD §5 AG-003, PRD §5 AG-004, PRD §5 AG-005]. Runtime Task ActiveForm: Adding unit coverage for X refinement and bbox sync. Extend `tests/unit/test_ocr_bbox_refine.py` with cases that verify left/right whitespace trimming and left/right extension recovery, plus assertions that span bbox follows refined line bbox in both X and Y while preserving debug keys.
- Blocked By: I100
- Acceptance: Unit tests include X-trim and X-extend scenarios, bbox synchronization assertions for element/line/span, and existing debug-field assertions remain valid.

## T300
- Subject: Run OCR refine integration regression tests
- Description: PRD Section Refs: [PRD §6, PRD §5 AG-005]. Runtime Task ActiveForm: Running OCR refine integration regression tests. Execute targeted integration tests that cover OCR merge/refine wiring (including `tests/integration/test_generator_ocr_merge.py`) and resolve any regressions caused by XY refine changes.
- Blocked By: Q200
- Acceptance: Targeted OCR integration tests pass without introducing regressions in OCR merge/refine behavior.

## E400
- Subject: Run end-to-end OCR conversion smoke check
- Description: PRD Section Refs: [PRD §3.1, PRD §6]. Runtime Task ActiveForm: Running end-to-end OCR conversion smoke check. Perform one CLI conversion smoke run using an existing demo sample to verify the full OCR-to-PPT path still succeeds with XY-refined bboxes and produces a valid output PPT artifact.
- Blocked By: T300
- Acceptance: One OCR end-to-end smoke conversion completes successfully and generates a PPT output file using the updated XY refine logic.

## D500
- Subject: Validate debug bbox diagnostics contract
- Description: PRD Section Refs: [PRD §2.1, PRD §4 FR-003, PRD §5 AG-004]. Runtime Task ActiveForm: Validating debug bbox diagnostics contract. Confirm the refine output still carries `ocr_bbox_original`, `ocr_bbox_pad`, and `ocr_bbox_refined` after XY changes and ensure diagnostics semantics remain consistent with existing debug expectations.
- Blocked By: E400
- Acceptance: Debug bbox fields remain present and semantically consistent in refined OCR text elements after XY refinement.

## C900
- Subject: Complete final verification and close implementation
- Description: PRD Section Refs: [PRD §5, PRD §6]. Runtime Task ActiveForm: Completing final verification and closing implementation. Run the final required test command set for touched OCR refine/unit/integration coverage, verify no unresolved blockers remain in the task chain, and prepare the implementation for coding completion handoff.
- Blocked By: D500
- Acceptance: Final verification commands pass, chain dependencies are fully satisfied, and the change set is ready for coding completion.
